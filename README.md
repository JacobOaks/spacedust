### Overview

Spacedust is an android game with a simple concept: you control a spaceship lost in deep space, and every other spaceship wants to blow you up until you're nothing but spacedust.

This app was built upon OpenGL ES, a subset of OpenGL meant for mobile and embedded systems. It was a short project, but it taught me how to create a game with mobile in mind, especially how differently controls work from PC. I programmed the joysticks myself, working with simple touch/hold input data from Android. Everything else seen here - textures, rendering pipeline/shaders, basic physics and lighting - is also custom made.

I'd like to iterate on this project with new prototypes containing more than one level, some sort of ship progression/customizability, more enemy variety, some sounds, some more level design, some particles and explosions, and maybe some more fleshed out story/missions. 

### Building

I've included all the gradle setup files, so it should be straightforward to import the whole repo as a gradle project into Android Studio. *Should* be.
